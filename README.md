## 👋 Aykhan Pashayev

🎓 Cybersecurity Student @ Florida International University (Class of 2026)
🔐 CompTIA Security+ | ☁️ AWS Solutions Architect – Associate

## 🧭 Overview

I’m a cybersecurity student focused on cloud security, infrastructure design, and monitoring systems.

I learn best by building environments, observing how they behave, breaking them on purpose, and then fixing them properly.

## 🎯 Technical Focus Areas
### ☁️ Cloud Security & Observability

Logging, monitoring, and alerting are where I spend most of my time.
Recent work includes CloudTrail- and CloudWatch-based detection, event-driven automation, and response workflows using Lambda and EventBridge.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure & Automation

I prefer repeatable, scripted setups over one-off configurations.
If something can be defined as infrastructure or automated safely, that’s usually the direction I take.

### 🔐 Security Fundamentals

IAM design, least-privilege access, network boundaries, and understanding how misconfigurations actually get exploited — not just documented.

### 🤖 AI + Security

Exploring where AI can realistically help with detection, analysis, and secure development — while staying aware of its limits and risks.

## 🧪 Experience
### 🏫 Hardware Lab Assistant / Course Learning Assistant @ FIU

I help students troubleshoot Linux, networking, OS, and programming labs.
Teaching forced me to explain concepts clearly instead of hiding behind jargon.

## 🧱 Projects & Repositories

Most repositories here are:

- cloud security labs rebuilt from scratch

- experiments to validate how AWS services behave

- small tools created to understand a specific problem

- If a repo exists, it’s because it answered a real question I had.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

## 🚀 Career Direction

I’m building toward cloud security, security engineering, or platform engineering roles where reliability and security matter more than buzzwords.

### 🌍 Open to opportunities in the U.S. and Europe.

## 📝 Notes

All work here is educational and ethical.
The goal is to understand systems deeply enough to secure them properly.
